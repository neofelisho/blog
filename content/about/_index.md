Hi there! My name is Neo Ho and I am a software developer from Taiwan.

I am interested in desiging and crafting efficient software.
I have experience in C# more than 10 years, and I also have experience in Java, Node.js and Lua Script in working.
Recently I study Golang and Docker, and try to use them to do my side project.
